// f1-pit-wall — a team pit-wall perch: a clad, canopied enclosure standing on the FIA barrier.
// 1.00 m deep shell, <= 2.20 m overall, one bay per GARAGE_BAY_PITCH.
//
// Depth convention: -Z is the track, +Z is the pit lane.
//
// The prop is a *branded enclosure*, not an open desk. The team colour is the whole shell — clad plinth,
// body, end panels and canopy — because that is what a perch reads as from anywhere in the pit lane; a
// sponsor stripe on a grey counter reads as a grey counter. A raked canopy oversails the working side,
// the monitor bank is a dark trough cut into the body's pit-lane elevation with its lit faces tipped up
// at the crew, and the crew sit on a row of individual high-backed stools spread along the whole run,
// mounted proud of the pit-lane face and facing the track.
//
// Brand: pass `primary` / `accent` (and optional plate colors / legend) — `configure` rebuilds the shell,
// canopy, drip band, roof emblems, sponsor run, fascia plates and stool upholstery from those values.
//
// Crew: `seats` and `tvs` are counts for the whole installation, spread evenly along the run, not per
// bay. `tvs` defaults to one screen per two seats and keeps following `seats` until it is set explicitly,
// so the default six-seat perch gets three screens, each landing between the pair it serves.
//
// Envelope: with `benches: false` the whole prop stays inside the 1.00 m x 2.20 m FIA signalling
// envelope, so a bare shell can be abutted end to end at `bays * GARAGE_BAY_PITCH`. With the stools
// installed both they and the canopy that shelters them oversail the pit-lane face — see CANOPY_D_BARE.
