// f1-grandstand-bay — one Silverstone-style seating bay: a raked bowl on an elevated deck, tip-up seat
// shells on standards, a hoarding-and-debris-fence frontage, and a tensioned membrane roof carried on
// slender front columns. configure({ rows, width, tiers, roof, stairs }).
//
// THE TWO TOP-LEVEL SWITCHES — the ones an emitter tiling a run of bays reaches for:
//
//   createModel({
//     rows: 8, width: 10, tiers: 3,
//     roof: 'full',   // 'full' (default) ONE canopy over the WHOLE section | 'top' top tier only
//                     // | 'none' no canopy at all | 'per-tier' obey tierSpec[k].roof
//     stairs: 'none', // 'none' (default) no end towers, so bays butt at `width` | 'left' | 'right'
//   })                // | 'both' | 'ends' (documented alias for 'both': a run end on both sides)
//
// PRECEDENCE. `roof` wins outright: `tierSpec[k].roof` is read ONLY when `roof === 'per-tier'`, so the
// per-tier field is an explicit opt-in rather than a hidden override. `stairs` is the opposite way round
// — it is only the DEFAULT each tier's `stairSide` falls back to, so a tier that sets `stairSide`
// explicitly wins for that tier. {@link F1GrandstandBayInstance.getFootprint} always reports the
// RESOLVED stairs, whichever of the two decided them.
//
// Datums read off the Silverstone reference: 0.44 m rise on a 0.80 m tread, a 1.10 m promenade sitting
// 0.95 m above ground, row 1 stepped a further 0.75 m up so it clears the hoarding, columns and rafters
// on a ~2.6 m bay pitch, and a roof that falls only 0.45 m across the span before its cantilever curls
// back up, so the canopy opens toward the track instead of shutting down onto it. `width` is the tiling
// module and the SEATING never overhangs it, so a run of bays reads as one continuous stand — the one
// thing that deliberately does overhang is an end stair tower, which is why `getFootprint()` exists (see
// TILING below). The red leading-edge fascia and the amber nosings are the catalogue tells — not a shed.
//
// `tiers` (1-4) stacks whole bowls, like Madring's S/F stand: tier k's promenade sits at tier k-1's
// bowlTop + ROOF_CLEAR (headroom for the concourse under it), and tier k's front CANTILEVERS
// OVERLAP_ROWS rows' worth of tread past tier k-1's rear edge — the balcony front overhangs the tier
// below rather than sitting flush on top of it (the Madring S/F photo's datum). Each tier's own closed
// bowl mass is already a full-depth slab underneath it (its loft profile's lowest point is local y=0
// across the WHOLE depth, front to rear — see {@link buildBowl}), so that overhang is automatically the
// soffit over the covered rows below — no separate soffit geometry needed. Each tier below the top still
// gets its own frontage (fascia/hoarding/guard-rail), landing right at the overhang's leading edge like a
// real balcony front, and a rear wall stretched to close the gap under the tier above (no see-through
// void). ONE roof — the existing membrane/rafter/column system — carries the stand, and by default
// (`roof: 'full'`) it spans the WHOLE section: rear tie at the top tier's own rear wall line, leading
// edge out over TIER 0's promenade, so a stack reads with the same profile as a rows-24 single-tier bay
// rather than a small lid parked on the top deck. `tiers: 1` is untouched: same single bowl, same
// canopy, same geometry as before, byte for byte.
//
// `tierSpec` (indexed by tier, 0 = bottom) makes every one of those per-tier decisions configurable, so a
// stack is never left floating with no visible means of support:
//   - `rows` — this tier's own row count (default `config.rows`).
//   - `plinth` (tier 0 only) — deck height above ground (default `DECK`, 0.95 m). A taller plinth raises
//     the front wall and the whole stack above it rigidly; it does not change any tier-to-tier clearance
//     (those are all rise-relative, not ground-relative — see the `rebuild` origin derivation).
//   - `lift` (tiers ≥1) — EXTRA clear height added above the default step, e.g. `tierSpec[1].lift` to
//     raise just the middle tier.
//   - `overlapRows` (tiers ≥1) — how many rows of tread this tier's front cantilevers past the tier
//     below's rear edge (default `OVERLAP_ROWS`).
//   - `support` — what carries THIS tier at its front (cantilever-tip) edge: `'columns'` (default) plants
//     a column line, on the roof's own bay pitch, from the tier below's `surfaceY` up to this tier's flat
//     underside (local y = 0), plus a raking stringer down each side to the rear support so the soffit
//     visibly rests on something rather than just closing as a slab; `'wall'` is a solid panel instead of
//     columns; `'none'` leaves it open. For tier 0 — which already stands on a closed loft face reaching
//     the ground (the plinth) — `'columns'`/`'wall'`/`'none'` are all a no-op: there is nothing to add or
//     remove, tier 0 was never floating.
//   - `rearSupport` — the back of the stand: a column line (with X cross-bracing per bay) or wall running
//     from TRUE GROUND up to this tier's own rear-wall height, at the rear face. Every tier above ground
//     gets its own rear tower rather than one member spanning past intermediate tiers, because each tier
//     steps further back as it stacks (see `tierStep.z` below), so the towers never collide.
//   - `stairSide` (`'left' | 'right' | 'both' | 'none'`; defaults to the top-level `stairs` for tiers ≥1,
//     `'none'` for tier 0) — which END face carries this tier's access stair. The stair is NOT across
//     the front of the bowl: it is a stair TOWER bolted to the bay's end face (x = ±halfW), travelling
//     along Z and climbing from the tier below's promenade to this tier's, exactly as a
//     temporary-stand scaffold tower does (Madring IMG_2437). See {@link buildStairTower}.
//   - `stairWidth` (default 1.4 m — f1-stairs' own flight width) — the flight width of that tower.
//     A folded tower is two lanes wide (`2 × stairWidth + STAIR_GAP`); a straight one is one lane.
//   - `roof` (default: top tier only) — lets a non-top tier carry its own membrane roof too, gated by a
//     thrown clearance check against the tier stacked above it. IGNORED unless the top-level
//     `roof: 'per-tier'` asks for it (see PRECEDENCE above).
// Any field left out of a given tier's (partial) entry falls back to the default above, so `tiers: 3`
// alone still builds a complete, fully-supported stack. `tiers` may also be given directly as the
// `tierSpec` array (`tiers: [{...}, {...}, {...}]`), in which case `tiers = tiers.length`.
//
// TILING. `width` is the module and the SEATING never leaves it, but a stair tower deliberately does —
// it hangs off the end face. {@link F1GrandstandBayInstance.getFootprint} reports both numbers so an
// emitter tiling a run of bays can place towers only at the ends. That is why the top-level `stairs`
// DEFAULTS to `'none'`: a bay squeezes against its neighbours at exactly `width` unless asked otherwise,
// and the EMITTER decides which bay gets a tower — the two end bays pass `stairs: 'ends'` (or `'left'` /
// `'right'` for the outward face only) and the run's overall width is `getFootprint().totalWidth` on
// those, `width` in between.
//
// COLLISION. {@link F1GrandstandBayInstance.getCollisionVolumes} / `parts.collision` are a first cut at
// what a physics engine should be given for one placed stand: a handful of CONVEX volumes (one prism per
// tier's bowl mass, one box per support line, one box per stair tower) instead of the whole visual
// trimesh or one fat whole-model AABB. The roof is deliberately excluded — nothing that collides ever
// reaches it, and leaving it out is what keeps the proxy cheap and stops the canopy's cantilever from
// inflating an AABB out over the track. The group is NOT parented to `root` (so it can never reach the
// visual/compile path); `createModel({ debug: { collision: true } })` parents it for a capture.

   * The SECTION-spanning canopy — `roof: 'full'`, the default, and the fix for "the canopy up top doesn't
   * extend over the whole section like it does for rows 24 tiers 1".
   *
   * ONE membrane for the whole stand: the rear tie stays exactly where the top tier's own roof tied it
   * (that tier's `bowlTop + ROOF_CLEAR`, at `zBack`), and the leading edge runs all the way out to TIER
   * 0's `halfD + ROOF_FRONT` — the same line a single-tier bay's roof leads at. So the profile reads as
   * one rafter falling ROOF_FALL from the rear tie to the front, then the TIP_U curl opening the canopy
   * out over the track, which is the rows-24 single-tier silhouette at three-tier height.
   *
   * NOTHING is forked to do it. `rafterAt` / `membranePanel` / `bayWeb` / `roofRafters` / `roofEdges` /
   * `buildRoof` / `buildColumns` / `buildFascia` are all parameterised by the layout's
   * `zBack`/`zFront`/`yBack`/`yFront`, so the canopy is literally the TOP tier's layout with `zFront`
   * pushed forward. `tiers: 1` takes the early return — today's three calls on today's layout object, in
   * today's order — which is what keeps a single-tier bay byte-identical.
   *
   * CLEARANCE. A longer span is a longer chance to dip: the straight rafter line is checked against every
   * tier's exposed mass top (`bowlMassTopAt`) at CLEAR_SAMPLES stations across the depth that tier
   * actually shows to the sky, and `yFront` is RAISED until the whole line clears `ROOF_CLEAR`. Raising
   * the front only opens the canopy further toward the track, so ROOF_FALL/TIP_U/ROOF_LIFT semantics
   * survive; a solve that would push the leading edge ABOVE its own rear tie means the stack is wrong,
   * not the roof, and throws.
