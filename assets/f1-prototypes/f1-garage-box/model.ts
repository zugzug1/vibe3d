// f1-garage-box — one F1 pit garage bay (7 m pitch, 20 m deep, 3.3 × 3.0 m door). The bay is a thick
// structure, not a printed elevation: chunky front piers, a fascia beam that cantilevers 0.7 m over the
// pit lane on a dark soffit, a coiled-shutter barrel behind the reveal, guide tracks, a coped roof edge,
// and a cast plinth that steps down over a threshold nosing onto a drained apron.
//
// The white is a value ramp, not one flat coat: fascia face, coping, applied faces, column return,
// flank, roof deck and soffit lining are each the shell colour moved along its own ramp with `shade`,
// so the thickness of every mass reads in light instead of only in silhouette.
//
// Fascia is procedural: pass `number` / `legend` / `style` to stamp a built-in plate, or
// `setMaterial('fascia', yours)` to hang an image. `count` tiles boxes along X at GARAGE_BAY_PITCH —
// bays occupy the full pitch, so neighbours share a pier and the run reads as one continuous facade.
