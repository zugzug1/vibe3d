## 0.0.19

Handheld chequered finish flag and a pit-straight evaluation scene. The flag
grips at the origin so a host character can parent it; cloth and stick wave in
`update`. The scene places every kit id along a short straight (7 m garage
pitch, WALL_FITS gates, short turf/gravel modules). Kit is 71.

## 0.0.18

Astroturf and gravel strips. The verge is a dark soil bed under a two-tone
mown pile, not a mint slab of card blades. The trap is pebble-scale Weyl-cycled
stones with rake furrows, not sugar-cube pavers. No new ids; kit stays 70.

## 0.0.17

Race control, sector gantry, spectator bridge, cone, and grid box. Race
control is a glazed tower with an RC plate and roof dishes. The gantry hangs
a readable S2 fascia. The bridge is a warren truss with end stairs. The cone
has a square base and two horizontal white bands. The grid stall sits on
asphalt with a large in-ground number. No new ids; kit stays 70.

## 0.0.16

Flag pole, camera platform, medical post, foam monitor, and camera tower.
The pole flies a 2:3 Dutch tricolor framed on the cloth. The platform is a
scaffold deck with a broadcast camera. The medical post is a hut with door,
window, and red cross. The foam monitor is a red cannon on a four-wheel
trailer. The camera tower keeps an open lattice and frames two camera heads.
No new ids; kit stays 70.

## 0.0.15

Weekend extras and the two CHECO boards. Weighbridge is a ribbed scale with KG
cabinet; parc-ferme is a mesh compound with a gate and PF plate; generator is an
amber genset with louvers and exhaust; tunnel is a dark throat with chevrons;
bollard is yellow PE with reflective rings; CCTV heads and PA horns read at
catalogue distance. Pit-board is a handled timing tray (P2 / IN / BOX); nameboard
stays the hung CHECO 11 plate on a pit-wall stub. No new ids; kit stays 70.

## 0.0.14

Trackside identity pass. Jersey modules punch a through-drain at the NJ kink. TecPro is stacked amber PE with teeth, handles, and straps. Armco is galvanized W-beam with red/white reflectors. Catch fence uses a coarse chain-link DataTexture plus a trackward overhang. Start lights are five emissive columns (no SpotLights). Grandstand bay keeps InstancedMesh seats and adds amber nosings plus a red fascia board. No new ids; kit stays 70.

## 0.0.13

`f1-service-truck` Super Space Cab floor sits at the window belt with two
high-back seats (cushion, back, headrests) visible through the glass. Headlights
are lamp buckets + lenses with visor spots and roof markers; lamps on and bloom
in `createPreview`. Steer hubs are punched 10-hole bright metal over a dark
well; drive duals share one deep-dish steel hub. Preview parks in place.

## 0.0.12

Walls and runoff identity pass. Concrete wall, jersey, sausage, astroturf, gravel,
access gate, crash cushion, crowd fence, marker post, and slot drain now read at
catalogue distance from geometry (bay joints, NJ kink and drain slots, Type 4
modules, grass pile, readable stones, marshal-gap stubs, stepped attenuator,
weldmesh, square distance post, grate + slot). Stairs overpass unchanged. No
new ids; kit stays 70.

## 0.0.11

`f1-service-truck` highway 315/80R22.5 wheels on spinning hubs, raycast onto the preview ground, and a see-through Super Space Cab with seats / dash. Live preview parks in place (`wheelRpm` from 8 m/s of spin, no root translation) with bloom and interior light on. No DAF marks.

## 0.0.10

`f1-stairs` is a galvanized FIA 180/280 flight (open grating, channel
stringers, raked rails, toe boards) that composes into `kind: 'overpass'`
— a warren-truss overhang pass whose deck clears the 5.5 m catch fence.
Hosts instance flights or span the circuit with one configure call.

## 0.0.9

DAF XG+ critic pass on `f1-service-truck`. Cab is a pinched Super Space Cab
with a recessed grille cassette, visor light bar, hook DRLs, A-pillar camera
stalks, and Dawn emissive bloom in the demo (`createPreview({ bloom: true })`).
Trailer keeps the hospitality window belt, black nose, and black-to-white swoop.
Median resemblance vs a public XG+ 3/4 plateaued in the 40s — remaining gap is
class-A surfacing and outdoor IBL, not the 16.50 m envelope. No Cadillac / DAF
marks.

## 0.0.8

DAF XG+ high-roof artic replaces the Tesla Semi cab. `f1-service-truck` is an
unbranded tractor + box trailer inside the EU 96/53 16.50 m envelope (black
cab, black-to-white trailer swoop, TEAM disc — no Cadillac / DAF marks).
Magnum is Moët-green glass with gold foil; no house name. Ceremony fascias
default to a Three.js step-and-repeat of invented marks (`sponsorWallTexture`).
Driver plates default to Checo 11 in black and white (`DRIVER`).

## 0.0.7

Wave E cull. Dropped 15 invented, duplicate, or catalog-stub props: trophy
bowl, trophy plinth, gazebo, drink wall, a-frame, feather flag, stillage, hand
trolley, cable ramp, pit totem, fan screen, start clock, barrier sleeve,
banner bridge, press riser. Kit is 70. Remaining ceremony and display objects
were rebuilt against photographed Dutch GP / FIA Appendix 5 millimetres.
Real-object rule: delete the folder — do not keep a catalog-id mesh. No
replacement wave.

## 0.0.6

Ceremony wave AAA. `f1-podium` follows FIA Appendix 5 plus the 2026 F1-supplied
dais (P2 | P1 | P3, carpet, 1.20 m walkway, 0.50 m flag slot, numbered faces,
solid backdrop). `f1-trophy-cup` is the 0.60 m Piet Boon / Royal Delft
Zandvoort winner's cup.

## 0.0.5

Wave E paddock / ceremony furniture. Shared 1:1 numbers in
`f1-kit-core/paddock.ts` (EU 96/53 rigid truck) and `ceremony.ts` (cups, LED
ribbon). `f1-service-truck` is one assembleable vehicle (`kind` / wheelbase /
boxLength / axles / livery), not five ids. Fascia props take `stamp|fia|blank`
plates or `setMaterial` for a host image. No real team, sponsor, or
championship-trophy IP.

## 0.0.4

Wave 3 1:1 FIA datum pass. Shared numbers live in `f1-kit-core/track.ts`
(FIA-published kerbs, walls, lights, and grid; Grade 1 garage / pit-wall /
race-control envelopes) so props cannot invent a second height.


## 0.0.3

Circuit furniture so a host can instance a full lap: walls, runoff tiles,
FIA boards, a pit garage/wall pair (7 m bay, procedural fascia), S/F heroes,
and a fourth weekend wave (cones, weighbridge, parc fermé, medical post,
generator cabin, flag pole, camera platform, tunnel portal, sector gantry).

Shared `WALL_FITS`, `GARAGE_BAY_PITCH`, `CIRCUIT_SIGN_KINDS`, `FASCIA_STYLES`,
`fasciaTexture`, and `circuitSignTexture` live in `f1-kit-core`. Pass
`number` / `legend` / `style` (`stamp` | `fia` | `blank`) for stamped fascias,
or `setMaterial('fascia', yours)` for an image.

## 0.0.2

Trackside wave: catch fence, Armco, tyre barrier, TecPro, start lights,
kerb, floodlight, timing pylon, brake marker, jumbotron, marshal post,
start gantry, grandstand bay.

## 0.0.1

Initial release: 10 pit-lane props (tyres, pit tools, garage
equipment, and signage & structures) plus the `f1-kit-core` shared support
library.
